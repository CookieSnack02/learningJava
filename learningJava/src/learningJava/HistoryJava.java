		 ** 
		 * Java emerged** as an heir to the C and C++ languages.
		 * 
		 * The **C language was** created to be efficient and to replace *assembly*
		 * language *in* systems development. The C language was a game changer in terms
		 * of gaining ground between abandoning one language in favor of another. For
		 * example, FORTRAN was used to write scientific programs efficiently, but it
		 * was not good for coding systems. BASIC was easy to learn, but not as
		 * powerful. Assembly was the high level of program production, but it was not
		 * easy to learn and not as efficient.
		 * 
		 * The **C++ language** was created to meet the needs of C in **the** **1980s**.
		 * The word that defines the creation of the C++ language is **complexity**.
		 * Complexity was what led to the creation of the language, mainly due to the
		 * modularity required as a result of large lines of code for the programmer to
		 * work with. Thus, the language was created with **a focus on object-oriente**
		 * .
		 ** 
		 * Java**, on the other hand, was created in **1991 by** **Sun Microsystems,
		 * INC**. with the aim of meeting another apparent need: **platform
		 * independence**.
