# Java Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress in learning the Java programming language. It contains implementations of mathematical algorithms and exercises focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## 📚 Study Reference
The code and concepts applied here are based on the study of **"Java: The Complete Reference"** by Herbert Schildt.

### Zeller's Congruence Implementation
A Java program that calculates the day of the week for any given date using Zeller's Congruence formula.

**Key Logic:**
- **Input:** Takes day, month, and year from the user via `Scanner`.
- **Algorithm:** Adjusts the formula for the Gregorian calendar (treating January and February as months 13 and 14 of the previous year).
- **Output:** Returns the specific day of the week (e.g., Saturday, Sunday, Monday).
